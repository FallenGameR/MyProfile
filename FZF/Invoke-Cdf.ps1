# This allows us to control
# - what folders are excluded (hidden folders and files and folders that start with dot like .git)
# - in what order do we see the output (similar to ls order)
# - make sure that we use command that is OneDrive friendly (Linux find downloads everything while enumerating)
# - allow fzf to terminate output early (piped in input blocks fzf from exit)
